# Piwik Pro Tag for Google Tag Manager Server Side

Piwik has already gained significant popularity thanks to its robust data control and strong privacy compliance. It’s a reliable alternative to common analytics tools like Google Analytics 4 (GA4) or Mixpanel.
With to Piwik Pro Tag, you can easily integrate Piwik into your server-side Google Tag Manager. The integration of Piwik Pro into the server will bring a lot of benefits compared to client-side:

- **More accurate data** - The tag is independent of third-party cookies, so any limitation (like ad blockers or browser restrictions) won’t affect the data you collect.
- **Higher data security** - You control all the data that is being collected from your website visitors, helping ensure compliance with data protection laws like GDPR.
- **Faster website load** - Server-side tracking eliminates the need for JavaScript tracking code on your site, which can slow down page load times. Removing this code can improve load speed by up to 72%.
